Source - youtube (code with harry)


Topics covered:
    - intro to DSA
    - intro to how memory is allocated for a program, 
    - intro on how memory is utilised in Stack, when to use Heap
    
    - Intro to Time complexity and Big O notation
        Time complexity : It is the study of the efficiency of the algorithm
            - O(1) : time always remains constanst irrespective of size of operation 
            - O(n) : runs with a linear time, i.e, time taken to complete operation increases if the size of the operation increases
