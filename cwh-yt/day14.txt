Topics covered:

    1 - Revisit Bubble Sort:
        1.1 - Time Complexity is O(n^2)
        1.2 - Is is a stable sorting algorithm ? Yes, it is a stable sorting algorithm as order is same as input array
        1.3 - Is it an adaptive sorting algorithm ? By default, it is not an adaptive sorting algorithm
            it can be made an adaptive sorting algorithm, as it can be optimized for already sorted array
        1.4 - the time Complexity can be under O(n) for already sorted array

    2 - Intro to Insertion Sorting
        2.1 - Time Complexity is O(n^2) - worst case
                Worst case occurs when array is sorted in reverse order
        2.2 - Best case occurs when array is already sorted
                Time Complexity is O(n) - best case
        2.3 - By nature, it is an adaptive sorting algorithm
        2.4 - By nature, it is a stable sorting algorithm

    3 - Intro to Selection Sorting
        3.1 - Time Complexity is O(n^2)
        3.2 - By nature, it is not an adaptive sorting algorithm
        3.3 - By nature, it is not a stable sorting algorithm as order is not same as input array
        3.4 - Sorting can be done in minimum number of swaps
        3.5 - cons of this algo:
            3.5.1 - Inefficient for large datasets
            3.5.2 - Doesn't take advantage of existing order in the list
            3.5.3 - Not stable
            3.5.4 - Non-Sequential Memory Access
            3.5.5 - Less Suitable for multi-core processors
