Topics covered:

    1 - introduction to Circular Linked List
        Circular Linked List is a Linked list where the last node points to the head node
        
    2 - Operations on Circular Linked List
        insertion,deletion same as normal linked list
        in insertion the node is inserted at the end at most cases and the head pointer is updated to point the relevent node
    
    3 - introduction to Doubly Linked Lists
        Operations on Doubly Linked Lists
        the main difference is there will be a pointer prev which will store address of the previous node
    
    4 - introduction to Stack data structure
        it is a data structure which follows LIFO Order, i.e, the last element inserted will be the first element which can be deleted
        Stack can be implemented using an Arrays or a Linked List

        4.1 - Application of Stack:
            Used in function calls
            Infix to postfix conversions (and other similar conversions)
            paranthesis matching & more...
        
        4.2 - Operations that can be performed on Stack:
            push() - push/insert an element into the Stack
            pop() - pop/remove the topmost element from the Stack
            peek(index) - value at given index is returned
            isEmpty() - check if Stack is Empty
            isFull() - check if Stack is Full
        
        4.3 - Some Operations on Stack with code
            C++ has builtin library/implementaion of Stack under the STL library
            Stack implementaion using Arrays can be found in StackArray.cpp file
            linked list implementaion of Stack is the same as a singly linkedlist (SLL), which can only insert/delete at the End
